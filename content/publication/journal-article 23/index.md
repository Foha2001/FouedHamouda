abstract: This paper analyzes the returns and volatility connectedness between oil prices and Eurozone sector returns during the global financial crisis. We employ the TVP-VAR frequency connectedness approach with daily data of Brent prices and 18 Eurozone supersector indices from 15 November 2014 to 24 November 2023. Our results show a high average connectedness of the returns and volatilities. Industrial Goods are the largest transmitter contrariwise Media supersector is the largest receiver of shocks on returns. However, Industrial Goods and Services transmit the highest volatility shocks in conjunction, the Media has the highest receiver volatility indices. The time-varying connectedness (TCI) of returns and volatilities in both show a drastic increase in March 2020. This increase is a result of COVID-19. Whereas, there has been no rise in connectivity following Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine.
