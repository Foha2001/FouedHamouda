abstract: This study seeks to develop a measure method of national culture based on cultural origins. Two cultural dimensions are studied; power distance (POWD) and uncertainty avoidance (UAV). Methodology used is SEM method under LISREL approach. Findings show that environmental factors are able to determine cultural dimensions studied in our sample countries. Nevertheless, we found that cultural dimensions indicators’ have evolved and are no longer the same identified in prior researches suggesting that environment evolution’ sleeds to the creation of new subsistence means and new cultural needs.
