abstract: The unobservable nature of the national culture is one of the main limits of research studying the impact of values systemsâ€™ in management sciences. This is why we aim in this study to identify a measure to three cultural dimensions namely, individualism (IND), masculinity (MASC) and long-term orientation (LTO). Our methodology is based on structural equation modeling (SEM) under LISREL approach, where latent variables are economic and demographic characteristics. Findings for the cross-national study over a period of 7 years including Tunisia, France, and Canada show that ecological indicators are able to determine studied cultural dimensions. However, due to the dynamic character of culture, some studied indicators are no longer the same as identified in prior studies..
