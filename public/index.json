Its growth and chemical properties can be modified by agricultural practices especially mineral nutrition and irrigation. An experiment was undertaken to determine the effectiveness of exogenous foliar application of potassium and calcium against the adverse effects of NaCl-induced stress on Thyme. Salt stress decreased growth and photosynthetic assimilation rate. Leaf spray with K+ or Ca2+ reduced salt-induced damage by maintaining K+/Na+ and Ca2+/Na+ ratios, resulting in photosynthesis improvement under salt conditions. Salt-affected plants had higher concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in their shoot tissues indicating oxidative damage to their cell membranes; Increased K+ and Ca2+ supply reduced the accumulation of both. Salinity appears to have upregulated the activity of antioxidant defense enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase, glutathione reductase, peroxide guaiacol, Monodehydroascorbate reductase, as well as Dehydroascorbate reductase. The application of K+ and Ca2+ solutions onto the foliage of NaCl-affected plants further enhanced the activity of the antioxidant enzymes of the ascorbate glutathione cycle potentially allowing a better protection of the cell membranes from reactive oxygen species..","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Potassium and calcium improve salt tolerance of Thymus vulgaris by activating the antioxidant systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Foued Hamouda","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

You can enable this feature by toggling the highlight option in your config/_default/params.toml file.\n```python\rimport pandas as pd\rdata = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;data.csv\u0026quot;)\rdata.head()\r```\r renders as\nimport pandas as pd\rdata = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;data.csv\u0026quot;)\rdata.head()\r Charts Academic supports the popular Plotly chart format.\nSave your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example chart.json, and then add the {{\u0026lt; chart data=\u0026quot;chart\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.\nDemo:\n\r\r(function() {\rlet a = setInterval( function() {\rif ( typeof window.Plotly === 'undefined' ) {\rreturn;\r}\rclearInterval( a );\rPlotly.d3.json(\"./line-chart.json\", function(chart) {\rPlotly.plot('chart-653981274', chart.data, chart.layout, {responsive: true});\r});\r}, 500 );\r})();\r You might also find the Plotly JSON Editor useful.\nMath Academic supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.toml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with $...$ or $$...$$, respectively.\nExample math block:\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}\r{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$\r renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left |\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right |^2}$$\nExample inline math $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$ renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the \\\\\\\\ math linebreak:\n$$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\\\\\\r1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$\r renders as\n$$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\\n1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$\nDiagrams Academic supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid\rgraph TD\rA[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round)\rB --\u0026gt; C{Decision}\rC --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1]\rC --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2]\r```\r renders as\ngraph TD\rA[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round)\rB --\u0026gt; C{Decision}\rC --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1]\rC --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2]\r An example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid\rsequenceDiagram\rAlice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you?\rloop Healthcheck\rJohn-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria\rend\rNote right of John: Rational thoughts!\rJohn--\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Alice: Great!\rJohn-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Bob: How about you?\rBob--\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Jolly good!\r```\r renders as\nsequenceDiagram\rAlice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you?\rloop Healthcheck\rJohn-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria\rend\rNote right of John: Rational thoughts!\rJohn--\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Alice: Great!\rJohn-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Bob: How about you?\rBob--\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Jolly good!\r An example Gantt diagram:\n```mermaid\rgantt\rsection Section\rCompleted :done, des1, 2014-01-06,2014-01-08\rActive :active, des2, 2014-01-07, 3d\rParallel 1 : des3, after des1, 1d\rParallel 2 : des4, after des1, 1d\rParallel 3 : des5, after des3, 1d\rParallel 4 : des6, after des4, 1d\r```\r renders as\ngantt\rsection Section\rCompleted :done, des1, 2014-01-06,2014-01-08\rActive :active, des2, 2014-01-07, 3d\rParallel 1 : des3, after des1, 1d\rParallel 2 : des4, after des1, 1d\rParallel 3 : des5, after des3, 1d\rParallel 4 : des6, after des4, 1d\r An example class diagram:\n```mermaid\rclassDiagram\rClass01 \u0026lt;|-- AveryLongClass : Cool\r\u0026lt;\u0026lt;interface\u0026gt;\u0026gt; Class01\rClass09 --\u0026gt; C2 : Where am i?\rClass09 --* C3\rClass09 --|\u0026gt; Class07\rClass07 : equals()\rClass07 : Object[] elementData\rClass01 : size()\rClass01 : int chimp\rClass01 : int gorilla\rclass Class10 {\r\u0026lt;\u0026lt;service\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\rint id\rsize()\r}\r```\r renders as\nclassDiagram\rClass01 \u0026lt;|-- AveryLongClass : Cool\r\u0026lt;\u0026lt;interface\u0026gt;\u0026gt; Class01\rClass09 --\u0026gt; C2 : Where am i?\rClass09 --* C3\rClass09 --|\u0026gt; Class07\rClass07 : equals()\rClass07 : Object[] elementData\rClass01 : size()\rClass01 : int chimp\rClass01 : int gorilla\rclass Class10 {\r\u0026lt;\u0026lt;service\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\rint id\rsize()\r}\r An example state diagram:\n```mermaid\rstateDiagram\r[*] --\u0026gt; Still\rStill --\u0026gt; [*]\rStill --\u0026gt; Moving\rMoving --\u0026gt; Still\rMoving --\u0026gt; Crash\rCrash --\u0026gt; [*]\r```\r renders as\nstateDiagram\r[*] --\u0026gt; Still\rStill --\u0026gt; [*]\rStill --\u0026gt; Moving\rMoving --\u0026gt; Still\rMoving --\u0026gt; Crash\rCrash --\u0026gt; [*]\r Todo lists You can even write your todo lists in Academic too:\n- [x] Write math example\r- [x] Write diagram example\r- [ ] Do something else\r renders as\n Write math example Write diagram example Do something else  Tables Represent your data in tables:\n| First Header | Second Header |\r| ------------- | ------------- |\r| Content Cell | Content Cell |\r| Content Cell | Content Cell |\r renders as\n   First Header Second Header     Content Cell Content Cell   Content Cell Content Cell    Callouts Academic supports a shortcode for callouts, also referred to as asides, hints, or alerts.
